1. Copy the snmp.conf to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf on your ESX server, and change 
   it as required (at least change the system contact, location, and 
   SNMP community name)
2. Copy the vmware-stats script to the /etc/snmp directory, permission 755
3. Copy the check_esx2 to the plugins directory.  You may need to change the
   perl location and the statefile location in the script.
4. Add the definitions in checkcommands.cfg to your checkcommands.cfg file
5. You can now add services as in the example template!
6. vmware_monitor2.pl is a script to generate .rrd files and a dummy MRTG .cfg
   file that graph lots of things and can be viewed from a MRTG frontend such
   as routers2.  This script should be called with appropriate params every 5min
   if you want to do the graphing.  It uses the same agent as the Nagios stuff.
   Dont worry if you dont want to use it, it isnt compulsory!
